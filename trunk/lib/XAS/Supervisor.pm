=head1 NAME

XAS::Supervisor - A set of modules and procedures to supervise processes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A superivsor is a process that manages other processes. On Unix this would be
similar to init, which is the master process. 

=head2 xas-supervisor

This is the control process. It reads a configuration file to see what 
processes to start. Once they are started, the supervisor will make sure that 
they continue to run. 

When a process exits, the supervisor checks the exit status. If that status is
known, it will restart the process otherwise it will send alert that the process
has stopped.

=head2 xas-supctl

This is a command line tool to communicate with the supervisor. With this
tool you can stop, start, pause, resume or kill a managed process. You 
can also retrieve all of the processes that the supervisor knows about and
you can check the status of individual processes.
