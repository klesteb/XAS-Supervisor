XAS Supervisor is Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Kevin L. Esteb 

XAS is a set of modules, procedures and practices to help write
consistent Perl5 code for a datacenter operations environment. For the most 
part, this follows the Unix tradition of small discrete components that
communicate in well defined ways.

This system is cross platform capable. It will run under Windows as well
as Unix like environments without a code rewrite. This allows you to
write your code once and run it where ever.

This package provides the modules and procedures to provide a process
supervisor. The supervisor will spawn and manage background processes.
It's primary purpose is to keep a process running. There is a command 
line client that allows you to manipulate those processes.
